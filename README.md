## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system. This project is designed to be run with Docker, which handles all other dependencies.

-   **Docker Engine**: Version `20.10.0` or newer.
-   **Docker Compose**: Version `2.0.0` or newer (this is included with all modern Docker installations).

You can verify your installation by running `docker --version` and `docker compose version`.

‚û°Ô∏è **[Official Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)**

### How to Run the Application

Once the prerequisites are met, you can start the entire application stack (Frontend, Backend, and Database) with a single command.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:hirelens-challenges/Santiago-837721.git
    cd Santiago-837721
    ```

2.  **Make the startup script executable (only needs to be done once):**

    ```bash
    chmod +x start.sh
    ```

3.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    ./start.sh
    ```

The script will check for prerequisites, build the necessary Docker images, and start all services. Once it's finished, the application will be available at:

-   **Frontend**: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
-   **Backend API**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## üë§ Default Users

You can use the following default credentials to log in, or register a new user directly from the application's interface.

-   **Email:** `tony@mail.com` | **Password:** `password123`
-   **Email:** `vivi@mail.com` | **Password:** `password123`

_Note: Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt._
